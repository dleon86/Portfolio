      " The development of alternative Layer-1s could be a successful way forward for the blockchain industry and Web 3. 0 to shape the next generation of the Internet .\n",
      " Layer-1s that have healthy technological foundations and continually attract native projects will have a good chance of surviving across the bulls and bears phases of the market . The public blockchain will also continue to gradually differentiate into other different development paths like general purpose, privacy, and specialized application blockchains .\n",
      " The relatively new public chain Solana, which emerged in the last bull market, currently has a bear market FDV of less than 20 billion US dollars . The formation of a stable ecosystem that can enable more application value and hence drive more value at the Layer-1 protocol level in the long run .\n",
      " The three stages of the development of Layer-1 public blockchains can be divided roughly into the following three stages . The first stage was from 2008 to 2013 after Satoshi Nakamoto published the Bitcoin white paper and as the first invention of its kind, Bitcoin naturally became popular . The second stage was the addition of Turing completeness .\n",
      " The concept enabled the creation of smart contracts on the blockchain for the first time, and it now had the programmability to carry applications . At the same time, with the introduction of applications such as CryptoKitties, people first began to actually experience applications enabled by blockchain technology . Public Layer-1 blockchains created during this period generally focused on smart contract functionality .\n",
      " The characteristic public blockchain is a concept separated from the standard generalized public blockchain . It subdivides the characteristics of the blockchain at the level of technical characteristics, Product-Market fit, and value narrative . The development of blockchains will continue to differentiate further into alternative paths like permissioned systems, privacy-focused and specific application blockchains .\n",
      " The Aptos team believes that the user experience needs to be significantly improved in terms of security and scalability to reach mass adoption . The public mainnet look to be released in the third quarter of this year .\n",
      " The Aptos development team created the Move programming language to improve blockchain security . Not only is Move designed to write smart contracts, but it can also be used by users to manage their accounts, change node settings, adjust commission and add new features . The current Ecosystem includes stablecoins, DEXs, wallets, lending markets, and oracles .\n",
      " Sui attempts to solve the blockchain trilemma, but it focuses on scaling composable and dynamic NFTs for a wide range of Metaverse applications including gaming, social, and commerce . Sui achieved good financing results in the bear market (valuation of $2 billion), and released a token economics model before Aptos .\n",
      " Sui has issued incentivized testnet registration and released the Chrome extension self-hosted wallet “Sui Wallet” Besides the wallet, there are browsers, games, and social metaverse projects currently under construction . Sui’s organic positioning is more inclined to the expansion of a wide range of metaverse applications including games, social networking, and commerce .\n",
      " Assembly uses a process similar to the ETH2. 0 fraud-proof Rollup . Each smart contract chain built on Assembly is the real Layer 2. 5, which is a smart contract framework layer . The network cost of building applications or interactive use based on Assembly will be the lowest in the entire public blockchain market .\n",
      " Mina — a lightweight public blockchain with characteristic ZK-Snark technology . Mina is able to maintain a fixed size of the entire chain by using a series of self-referential cryptographic proofs .\n",
      " Mina has focused on the issue with the ever-increasing size of data and growth of transactions, accounts, tokens, contracts, and other on-chain information . The vision of Blockchain is to achieve self-validation, and Mina is the only blockchain that can achieve it . Mina’s non-consensus nodes will run on smartphones or browsers .\n",
      " Mina currently uses the Pickles inductive proof system to complete the KYC operation of certain applications without revealing the user’s identity information . EMIT-Core — a modular high-performance cross-chain public blockchain — is a sub-project of the EMIT project .\n",
      " EMIT-Core adopts a Random-Check algorithm to confirm blocks and supports diversified assets . Block-Lattice ledger is the vertically most limited sharding method as each account is a shard . It decouples transactions and splits them into two parts: origination and reception .\n",
      " EMIT aims to “integrate the assets of the crypto world and create an economically complete decentralized world” The EMIT project has its cross-chain wallet and ecological applications such as Cross, Chaos, Altar, TeamMining, StarGrid, RelicsMarket, Accounts, Assets, Bangs, etc. These are built on the basis of EMIT-Core technology .\n",
      " The development in public blockchains we observe tends to be modular, loosely coupled, and parallel to vertical application fields . The general-purpose L1 market such as ETH is gradually becoming a red sea . Even if the ETH 2. 0 merger and sharding expansion is completed, it does not mean that ETH will be able to fully handle the potential increased number of users and high demands .\n",
      " The high-performance demands of these 1,000 times additional users can obviously not be met . Even if it is crowded, there are still opportunities in the public blockchain space . The market needs a modular, general-purpose public chain that grafts and superimposes the best resources in the Web 3. 0 world .\n"
